# bootstrap-website-with-php-pdo-and-database
This is my bootstrap project. I used HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and PHP PDO for user/admin logins. ADMIN has the basic CRUD (add,edit,delete). Displays welcome+username. No code included for food of choice/price. Can fit to mobile xs, sm, md, lg. Excluded 'kebab' for mobile.

For database, I used phpmyadmin.
